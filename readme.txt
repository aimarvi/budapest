This folder contains information needed to collect the movie data using segments from The Grand Budapest Hotel and the anatomical scan data that is also needed for later analysis. Here is the list of contents.

1. Story_Line.pptx is recommended to be presented to the participants by the experimenter before the participants are taken to the scanner. These slides summarize the story that occurred before the movie segments played during scanning and highlight the major characters they will encounter to better align participants' understanding. The last slide can be used to provide participants with the story's ending after they finish the scanning session.

2. The "stim" folder contains the movie segments used in the data collection: budapest_part3.mp4 (7'57'') and budapest_part4.mp4 (8'35''). These were parts 3 and 4 in the original data collection in Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2020, and will serve as the main stimuli for the current data collection. The video budapest_soundcheck.mp4 (4'10'') is designed for sound volume adjustment during the anatomical scan (details in Imaging_details.docx and in Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2020).

3. The "scripts" folder contains the Python scripts for movie presentation in the experiment and the sound checks. They will need modification to fit the new version of PsychoPy and the current scanner.

4. Imaging_details.docx provides detailed information about the procedures and imaging parameters. The information was copied and pasted from Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2020.

5. Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al_2020_An fMRI dataset in response to “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, a socially-rich, naturalistic movie.pdf is the original article.
